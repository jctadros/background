This is a thresholding+inpainting toolkit for astronomic photometric images. The different scripts allows for the identification of ROI in photometric images using an Otsu thresholding and different interpolation schemes for the filling of the masked ROI based on bilinear interpolation and patch-based inpainting techniques based on Crimnsi et. al (2005) (https://www.irisa.fr/vista/Papers/2004_ip_criminisi.pdf) The following is the different techniques of image interpolation applied on the Crab nebula (M1) ...
